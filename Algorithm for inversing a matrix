ALGORITHM FOR CALCULATING INVERSE OF 2X2 MATRIX
1.Accept the 2x2 matrix from the user.
2.Calculate the determinant value of that matrix.
3.Check if the determinant of the given matrix is 0 or not.
4.If determinant is zero, the inverse does not exist.
5.Otherwise find the co-factor matrix.
6.Print the cofactor matrix.
7.Calculate adjoint(i.e, transpose of cofactor matrix) of the matrix.
8.Print the adjoint matrix.
9.Calculate inverse of matrix by inverse formula.
10.Print the inverse.
